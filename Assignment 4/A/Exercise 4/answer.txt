a. There are two types of searches, namely internal and external. External search is only implemented if searching is done on a very large size of data. Half of the data need to be processed in RAM while half of the data is in the secondary storage. Internal search is implemented on a small size of data. All data can be loaded into RAM while the searching process is conducted.
