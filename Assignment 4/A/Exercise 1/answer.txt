b. The searching time for 49 is short because it is at the front of the array. The searchinf time for 4 is long because it is at the end of the array. Tht time complexity is O(n).
c. break is used to break the for loop, enabling the program to continue. This is done after the search key is found in the array.

f. The sequential search on sorted list can terminate when the search key value is smaller than the item compared in the array.
